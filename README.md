## Summary
The following are the recommendations based on the analysis
- The total drivers are very low for rural and suburbs compared to urban areas which makes it less accessable for the rural and suburban population.
- The average fare per driver is very high in rural and suburbs due to less number of drivers. This might mean the company losing money trying to pay the difference between the average fare price and the average fare per driver. This can be mitigated by increasing the number of drivers in rural and suburbs.
- The average fare per ride is 10$ higher for rural areas and 6$ higher for suburbs compared to urban areas which might be due to people travelling a longer distance or in general the fare price is higher in rural and suburbs making it less affordable. Reducing the fare price for rural and suburbs will increase the affordability for these underserved cities.
